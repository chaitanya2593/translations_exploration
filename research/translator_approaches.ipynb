    "There are many metrics which we can use for the machine translation. But we need to choose the metrics which are more into the semantic similarity and also have some domain knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metric\tDescription\n",
    "- BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)\tMeasures n-gram overlap between the machine translation and reference translation. Higher scores indicate closer alignment with human references. It is widely used but can struggle with synonyms or paraphrasing.\n",
    "- ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)\tFocuses on recall-based overlap of n-grams, primarily used in summarization but applicable to MT. ROUGE-L specifically considers sequence alignment. It is helpful for evaluating fluency and coverage.\n",
    "- METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering)\tConsiders exact matches, stemming, synonyms, and paraphrases between translation and reference. It uses precision, recall, and a harmonic mean to give a more human-like judgment. It is better at capturing semantic similarity than BLEU.\n",
    "- TER (Translation Edit Rate)\tCalculates the number of edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions, and shifts) needed to make a machine translation match a reference. Lower TER scores mean fewer corrections are needed, reflecting better quality.\n",
    "- chrF (Character F-score)\tEvaluates translation quality at the character level instead of word level, making it suitable for morphologically rich languages. It combines precision and recall to account for partial matches, such as prefixes or suffixes.\n",
    "- COMET (Cross-lingual Optimized Metric for Evaluation of Translation)\tUses a neural network trained on human judgment to predict translation quality. COMET evaluates translations on adequacy, fluency, and consistency, making it more robust than traditional metrics.\n",
    "- BERTScore\tCompares contextual embeddings of the machine and reference translations using pre-trained models like BERT. It captures semantic similarity and paraphrasing better than n-gram-based metrics.\n",
    "- BLEURT (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy with Representations from Transformers)\tA transformer-based metric fine-tuned on human ratings, designed to predict translation quality. BLEURT captures semantic differences and aligns well with human judgments.\n",
    "- SacreBLEU\tA standardized version of BLEU with consistent preprocessing and tokenization, ensuring reproducibility across evaluations. It is simpler to use than traditional BLEU but shares similar limitations.\n",
    "- Human Evaluation\tThe gold standard, involving human raters who evaluate adequacy, fluency, and overall translation quality. It is costly and time-consuming but essential for benchmarking against automated metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well Human Evaluation is the last step so we need to focus on the other aspects. THe BLEU , ROUGE, TER, chrF n Meteor are more into the Frequency based approach.  Amoung the Transformer based approaches we can look into the BLEURT, COMET, SBLEU/DBLEU\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation for our Z+ Case\n",
    "- Start with Pre-trained BLEURT: Test the general pre-trained model to see how well it handles our translations.\n",
    "- Fine-tune if Necessary: If the BLEURT scores are not aligned with human judgments (e.g., it fails to recognize Z+ e-commerce-specific terms or paraphrasing), fine-tune the model using a smaller, domain-specific dataset. I am not sure we have any specific dataset inside Z+ for this.\n",
    "- A few thousand high-quality parallel sentences for fine-tuning are often sufficient.\n",
    "Ensure High-Quality Reference Data: Regardless of the approach, your dataset quality (e.g., accuracy and fluency of reference translations) is key to improving performance.\n",
